"""
NIST CSF 2.0 Control Mapping

Maps GERA Framework features to NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0
control families. Provides compliance tracking and audit report
generation for regulated enterprises.

Mapped controls:
- GV.OC: Organizational Context (sensitivity classification)
- GV.RM: Risk Management (anomaly detection thresholds)
- ID.AM: Asset Management (data assets and data-flow lineage)
- PR.AA: Identity Management & Access Control (ABAC + RLS)
- PR.DS: Data Security (hash chain + append-only audit)
- DE.CM: Continuous Monitoring (real-time gate decisions)
- RS.MA: Incident Management (exception severity and escalation evidence)
